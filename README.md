# Chip-8
 Chip-8 and Superchip-8 emulator for Atari 8-bit

Progammed in 2005-2006, compiled under omc65.

Would be nice to add new games and joystick driven game selection.

My most important contribution to Chip-8 scene is the configuration file CHIP8.CFG - it contains mapping of Chip-8 keys to a joystick.
